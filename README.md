# Cricket Game

This is a simple cricket game developed in Python using the Pygame library.

## Features

- Simple Scoring System: Awards runs based on the direction and power of the hit.
- Directional Batting: The batsman can hit the ball in three different directions.
- Adjustable Difficulty: The game offers different difficulty levels.
- Run and Wicket Tracking: The game keeps a live count of runs and wickets.

## Project Goals

This project was developed as a fun, practical way to learn more about Python programming and the Pygame library.
The project successfully fulfilled its purpose of deepening my understanding of Python and, more importantly, sparked a strong interest in game development.

## How to Play

1.  **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  **Install Pygame**: If you don't have the Pygame library, you'll need to install it. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3.  **Run the Game**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the main Python script.
    ```bash
    python main.py  
    ```
    Or just open the game with CRICKET 23.exe file

## Controls

- **Left, Right, and Down Arrow Keys:** Select the direction of your shot.
- **Timing:** The key to a successful shot is timing. Press the arrow key at the right moment to get the best result.
